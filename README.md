# Combinations-C
Combinations C was developed by me, <a href="https://github.com/TheWebs">TheWebs</a>, in order to learn C. It calculates all combinations with 4 or 5 digits. I could just create a variable i for example and i++ until 9999 or 99999.
However that wouldn't help at all when doing the same with letters.This way it's easier to addapt it i think.

# Features
* Calculates all combinations with 4 digits
* Calculates all combinations with 5 digits
* The 5 digits combinations calculation is presented with colors!
